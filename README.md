# CardiovascularDiseaseRiskPrediction
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information and other details. 

To do EDA on the data set, we first have to clean and prepare the data set. For that, I did Null Value Treatment and Data type check. Once the data was ready for EDA I went on ahead to see the distribution of our dependent variable(10 year CHD) alongside other features. I came up with certain Hypotheses for the problem and verified them using different tools(Hypothesis-driven EDA). The EDA gave me some idea of the data set and relevant features.
I plotted the correlation of all the features and dv. This helped me in feature selection and further data processing. Next, I applied Random Forrest and Decision tree algorithms to the data set after a test-train split. I used these to calculate feature importance. I also found that the accuracy of these tree-based algorithms was very very poor. Probably because of the high-class imbalance. I dropped certain irrelevant and highly correlated features using the correlation graph and feature importance calculations. 

I decided to apply SMOTE(synthetic minority oversampling technique) to my data set to balance the minority class. After applying smoot the data set was much more even. I also undersampled the majority class(not by much since I didn't want to lose any information). The next step was to apply different models to the data. 

I applied Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbours, Support Vector Machines(experimented with multiple kernels and chose the best one-Radial) and XG-Boost.  Since this is an imbalanced data set, I used evaluation metrics such as balanced accuracy, f1-score and AUC.

The Support vector machine with the radial kernel was the best performing model in terms of accuracy and the F1 score followed by XG-Boost. Its high AUC and this shows that it has a high true positive rate.
